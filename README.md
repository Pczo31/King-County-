# Phase 2 Project Description


## Project Overview

Our group has been employed by KC Realty Group of Seattle, WA to research and discover which combination of features in single-family homes most influence selling price. Our intent is to develop a multiple regresion model to reveal the top features that guide a home's price. For this project, we will be using the King County Housing Data Set for home sales in the year 2014 and 2015.

### Business Problem

It is up to you to define a stakeholder and business problem appropriate to this dataset.
This project's goal was to develop a model that accurately predicts housing prices in King County. Our goal was to help a Real Estate team in King County with showing them different types of models that would give them a better understanding on how they can help their clients with explaing which features in a home can improve property value and which features would not. We came up with a lot of different combinations of models showing to results.

### The Data

We had to clean out over 20,000 homes in the data set. How the dataset was broken down:
Home Features:
    Number of Bedrooms
    Number of Bathrooms
    Number of Floors
    Square footage of the lot
    Square footage of the living space for the nearest 15 neighbors
    Square footage of the house
    Square footage of the basement
Home Quality:
    The year the house was last renovated
    How good the condition of the home was (on a scale of 1-5)
Location:
    The zip code/city of the home
    If the home is on the water or not
Waterfront:
    Yes or No
View:
    Was sacled from worst to best (0-4)
we then dropped date, view, waterfront, yr_renovated, condition, zipcode, sqft_basement to have a better understanding of what the best features are for the home and property increase.




## Recommendations
